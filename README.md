gLifestream
===========

gLifestream is a free lifestream platform and social activity reader.
It is licensed under GPLv3.

Introduction
------------

gLifestream joins several external and/or internal streams into a
single one.  External streams may be represented by RSS/Atom channels
or popular services such as Twitter or Facebook.  The user decides
which of them are publicly visible and which are not.  Public streams
are visible for anybody.  The rest of streams are visible only for
logged in users.

The gLifestream software requires an HTTP server capable of running
Django applications and a database supported by it.  Data from the
configured streams are automatically pulled from the remote services
associated with them and stored in the database.  This mode of
operation ensures the user that his data (messages, links, photos,
etc.) will remain intact even if the external service they came from
ceases to exist.

To install gLifestream read the INSTALL file.
